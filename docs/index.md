## About Me

I'm a Solutions Architect with 12+ years of experience spanning technical sales, solution engineering, and cloud architecture. I design and deliver scalable systems that integrate cloud-native services, machine learning models, and automation workflows â€” all aligned to real-world business outcomes.

This GitHub Skills portfolio reflects my commitment to staying hands-on with the tools and practices my customers rely on â€” including GitHub Actions, Copilot, CI/CD pipelines, secure software delivery, and LLM-powered automation. These projects complement my work designing applied AI solutions that automate document processing, extract structured data, and support smarter, real-time decision-making.

In addition to solution design, I lead cross-functional collaboration between technical teams and business stakeholders. I also volunteer as a career coach through Pay Forward Coaching, helping professionals navigate career transitions and build long-term growth strategies.
